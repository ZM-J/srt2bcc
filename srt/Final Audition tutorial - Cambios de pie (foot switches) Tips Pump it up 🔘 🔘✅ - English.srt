Hi Pumpers OscarJark here

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,340
today we'll learn how to do foot switches

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:10,449
or "cambios de pie", like these

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,320
A foot switch appears when in a jump

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,580
or two repeated arrows it's more comfortable to jump

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,760
instead of using the same foot again.

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,380
Native Single 20 and Double 18

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,580
got a lot of these transitions

9
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,180
which I canÂ´t categorize as basic

10
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,120
because they require practice

11
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,840
In the PIU, there's no an only way

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,480
of hitting the arrows, however

13
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,000
if you donÂ´t do these kind of jumps

14
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,840
You'll have to repeat the foot

15
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,460
Allegro piu mosso single 16

16
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,420
has a lot of example of these jumps

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,680
Notice how I jump

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,240
every time there are two center arrows

19
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,260
The most common mistake is to be

20
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,920
pressing the center and with the other foot

21
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,600
try to press it again,

22
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,220
naturally it won't work because

23
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,640
we're already pressing it

24
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,460
Another common error is to stand completely in the center

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,960
if so you have to double your effort

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,420
to raise your feet

27
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,940
I recommend to stand in the metallic section

28
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,540
and interchange your heels one by one

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,560
Here is the rythm your feet should sound like

30
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,760
I also chaged the colors so you will

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,960
realize which foot is left or right

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,360
If you notice if we woud hit that

33
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,760
with only one foot the next step would be bacwards

34
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,400
that's why we know that's the way of doing it

35
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,960
That's it for this video

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll see you next time

37
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,520
See ya!.
