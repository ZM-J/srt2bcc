00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,580
What's up buddies?

5
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,080
Here's OscarJark

6
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,860
This is the first of a series of videos

7
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,290
In which we'll know the history of Pump it up

8
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,150
Without further ado, let's start

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,440
Pump it up is a dance simulator launched by the company Andamiro

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,160
which has 2 pads with 5 arrows

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,200
In each of them, a screen and speakers

12
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,200
But... What does Pump it up mean?

13
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,160
Is an English expresion used to cheer up people or turn something up

14
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,180
Therefore It would mean something as "turn it up" or "light it up"

15
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,220
Here J-o teaches us how to use it

16
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,780
Let’s get loud Let’s get loud

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,880
Let’s get loud

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,060
PUMP IT UP!

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,440
and another example

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,920
Don´t you know? Pump it up? You’ve got to pump it up

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,460
Don´t you know? Pump it up? You’ve got to pump it up

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,980
Don't you know? Pump it up?

23
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,210
and now let's move on to the dance machine

24
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,260
Everything started in 1999 in South Korea

25
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,660
when in August came out the first

26
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,540
Pump it up which was called  "The first dance floor"

27
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,220
This PIU had hits relatively recent in the country

28
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,980
The first game included 15 songs

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,920
which were 1.35 minutes long and 4 Non-Stop on average

30
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,520
Remix with about two and a half minutes of duration

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,380
Speeds  2x, 4x y 8x were avaliable

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,160
vanish, random, and non-step too

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,400
A drawback is that you could only chose from 4 songs per stage

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,620
Evidently the steps were very different from the ones we know now

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,500
Since there were only normal, hard and double difficulties

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:50,280
the hardest songs from the first  version were Hypnosis and Ignition starts

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,500
With an "astonishing" hard 7 and 8 respectively

38
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,660
But "nya" if you think about it everyone was learning

39
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,050
how to play in that moment

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,100
So they didn´t need as hard steps as today

41
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,020
the hardest remix was was the "Turbo remix"

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,420
In this game the most outstanding songs were: Funky tonight, Black cat

43
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:12,280
Forever love, Cordiality (now known as "Another truth").

44
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,580
There was battle mode in which you had to stomp the steps so your rival imitate them

45
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
Here's an example

46
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,060
If you notice the players stepped a sequence

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,280
that the rival the opponent had to immitate

48
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,440
When Andamiro realized the pontencial and acceptaion of its videogame

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,660
launched  "The Pump it up 2nd ultimate dance floor" only 4 months later

50
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,420
In which double mode and dupbles were added to

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,420
the Non-stop remixes, the steps patterns were more diverse

52
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,780
the interface was basicaly the same though

53
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Is here where we see  hits such as Final audition house come out

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,420
of Banya, group that had an even more important

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,170
participation  in this machine, giving us the hardest song

56
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,630
of the time that was "Extravaganza"

57
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,980
Com´back, Tell me tell me

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,100
and Curiosity satanded out as well

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,180
There were included 2 songs only avialable untlill the bonus stage

60
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,940
Fighting Spirits of H.O.T. and the Non-stop remix 7

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,239
We've gotten to May 2000 when Andamiro releases the O.B.G or the OBG In which

62
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,980
around 27 new tracks are released including a lot of 90' hits in Korea

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,780
that's why the name (Oldies but goodies)

64
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,040
which would mean something like ¿viejitas pero buenitas?

65
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,300
In this version existed the need of presenting crazy mode

66
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,020
due to the advances in the player's skill level

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,160
She likes pizza surprised players with an astonishing 230 BPM

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,220
"an interesting view" was outstanding. Not as the crazy level of Extravaganza though

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,670
currently single 11, the hardest song in that version

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,160
The crown speaking of difficulty in the Non-stop remix category

71
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,740
was for Banya  - Ignition starts, Hypnosis and Extravaganza  remix

72
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:24,660
The most outstanding songs were Caution or Don't Bother Me, We Are, Final Audition 2

73
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,860
and Turkey march of course.

74
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,520
Another big improvement was in the BGAs

75
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,760
or BGA's which stands for background animation

76
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,840
Because they told stories and they were

77
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,770
way better quality wise. Even the non-stop remixes had  their own

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,740
in contrast with the old remixes videos

79
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,840
which looked way more random and repetitive

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,880
That's it for this video. See you in the next one

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,660
See ya!.
