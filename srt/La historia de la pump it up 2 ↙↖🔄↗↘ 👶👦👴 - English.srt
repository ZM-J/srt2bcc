1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
One

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
Two

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Three

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:10,660
What's up pumpers?

5
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,540
OscarJark speaking

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,540
And this is the continuation

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,320
of "the history of Pump" video

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,359
If you haven't see it already here it is

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,299
so you don't lose the sequence

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,300
In case you remember it we finished

11
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,260
in the OBG.

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,380
Well, after the OBG in September 2000

13
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,720
The OBG season evolution

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,300
was released in korea

15
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,380
Which it was sopposed to be called

16
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:28,880
"Summer edition"

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,380
But due to some delays

18
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,830
the name was changed

19
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,500
because it was't even summer anymore

20
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,300
It was almost the same interface as the OBG

21
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,620
In this version 14 songs and 1 remix were added

22
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,440
The cool thing was that every chart had a crazy

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,740
Here emerged valuble songs such as

24
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,440
Solitary, Run to you, Mr. Larpus

25
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,880
which was the hardest song

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,760
due to the inclusion of sequences

27
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,900
of stairs, spins and twists

28
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,380
new for the time

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,280
On December 2000

30
00:00:58,290 --> 00:00:59,590
the PIU perfect collection was released

31
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,280
At this point the audio

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,240
quality has improved greatly

33
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
compared to the previous releases

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,940
In addition to the previous tracks

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,760
from older CD's

36
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,840
It gave us

37
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,040
the most emblematic and known

38
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,880
song that is popular among no-pumpers

39
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,500
I'm talking about Beethoven virus or

40
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,640
"Beethoven virus" as we call it here

41
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Banya and Taiji Boys were the most

42
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,540
popular bands

43
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,400
And the award for the most outstanding songs

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,420
was for Hayuga, I will accept you, Rolling christmas,

45
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,020
space fantasy, unforgettable memories and slam

46
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,020
the last 2 were the hardest

47
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:37,540
from the recently added

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,660
Mmm, not everything was as sweet as honey

49
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,020
because the display was unintuitive

50
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,460
and not easy for occidental people

51
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,400
because everything was in korean.

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,860
In the CD's the songs are numbered

53
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,980
release date wise, for instance

54
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,440
the first songs were from 101 and 
onwards

55
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,840
in the fifth which was the "Perfect collection"

56
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,870
they were from 501 onwards

57
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,140
The sequence was broken when

58
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,289
the rights were granted to F2 systems

59
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,289
to create the "Extra"

60
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,160
they were the creators of "Technomotion"

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,160
in which you could plat using 4 arrows

62
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,700
DDr style

63
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,440
5 Pump style

64
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,389
or 8 Technomotion stlyle.

65
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,840
They used songs of which

66
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,440
they already had the rights

67
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,000
and created Holiday and Can can

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,720
along with Trash man were

69
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
the 3 hadest songs in this version

70
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,140
another remarkable tracks from here

71
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,020
were Starian, Chicken wing

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,700
FAEP 1 and Monkey magic

73
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,740
A very important improvement the game

74
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,680
was born here

75
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,960
I'm talking about the long-notes or holds

76
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,800
that were introduced here

77
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,880
as well as the possibility

78
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,420
of changing to any level during the same credit

79
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
before if you started in hard mode

80
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,720
every single song had to be of that category

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Now you were able to change levels now

82
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,960
even to doubles.

83
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,320
Crazy mode was called "Extra expert"

84
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,180
and they  finally create double charts

85
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,819
with a higher difficulty

86
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:02,879
called doble extra experto

87
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,720
However, either the stepmakers

88
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,240
weren't experienced enough

89
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
to create worthy doubles

90
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,980
or they were auto-generated because

91
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,400
the steps were from one side to another

92
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,520
and they looked like their crazy version

93
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,760
Holiday was the most valuable

94
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,380
The CD, had several bugs

95
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,999
however, a strong point to the Extra

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,079
was the number of possible skins

97
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,519
from little shits, UFOs

98
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,120
even snow-men.

99
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,730
This version was released in Korea

100
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,760
even though It did

101
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,260
get popular in this continent

102
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,820
For the Pump it up the Premiere

103
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
that was commercialized world wide in 2001

104
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,289
some titles and song

105
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:43,289
names were modified

106
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,220
So they were in English and not in Korean

107
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,820
Version for the US and Brazil

108
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:49,820
were created, however, the difficulty

109
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,840
was too easy

110
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,800
that only take on me shone

111
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:56,689
Little time later " The Prex" came out

112
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:58,689
from the union of the Premiere an the Extra

113
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,190
using the same environment from " the Premiere"

114
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,690
We still have a long way

115
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,870
to go in the

116
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,180
PIU history videos

117
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,170
That's it for this video

118
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,170
See ya!.
