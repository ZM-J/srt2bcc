00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What's up pumpers? This is the 3rd video of the history of the Pump

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,240
If you do not remember the previous 2, here they are

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,600
in case you remember we stayed in The Prex,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,880
which  was the union between Premiere and Extra versions

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,620
Well, On May 2012 the Pump it up The Rebirth was released

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:28,040
The 8th dance floor, where Division mode was introduced

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,440
In Division mode you had to choose letters

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:33,040
to choose the difficulty; Gs (Groove) or Ws (Wild)

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,880
For  "Groove" mode You had to pick the letter G

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,600
It was a relaxed mode with jumps

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:43,560
If you pressed only Ws the chart will changed to a difficulty even harder than crazy

12
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:48,240
In a nutshell, this mode allowed you to change the difficulty in the middle of the song.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,940
This mode was quite original what
a shame  they didn't keep it!...

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,020
In addition to this mode, "half double" was introduced

15
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,400
which consisted on playing in the middle
with the 6 arrows where the two dance floors join.

16
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,900
In fact, so far the most difficult patterns to understand are in Half double segments.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,220
(in the middle).

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,840
This machine featured 36 new songs and any old

19
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,840
hence the name "rebirth" (The Rebirth).

20
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,520
DR. M, Love is a danger zone, Zzanga,

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,500
Csikospost, Winter, baby Swing outstanded

22
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,360
and the hardest Will O the Wisp and Vook

23
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,340
in single and double, respectively.

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,000
Then came the Premiere 2,
It had the 36 Rebirth songs

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,140
plus 66 more from the Premiere.

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,580
The new feature here was the inclusion of speed 3 (x3)

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,180
which made easier the reading of many steps

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,920
since many songs were slow by x2 but  fast x3

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,840
Can can was a clear example.

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,180
We later wlecomed Prex 2 where 21 songs Extra were added

31
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,960
so they're only compilations.

32
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,500
As early as May 2003 the Premiere 3 came out featuring Latin American pop songs

33
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,400
It was created by Andamiro especially for Latin America

34
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,990
where the game had already gained enough popularity

35
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,160
especially in Mexico where it was a hit.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,780
Here they returned the Half-double, which was no longer in an earlier version.

37
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,340
The most popular tracks of this
album were: Bee, Conga,

38
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,000
Join the party, Mexi Mexi, although the most complicated were

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,580
DJ. Nightmare and Beat of the War of Banya.

40
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,060
So we give way to 3 where Prex nightmare mode was introduced

41
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,140
since the pumpers were eager to have more difficult charts.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,060
Unlike "Extra expert" steps for double on the Extra version

43
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:57,680
the charts quality  was clearly superior with better arrow sequences.

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,700
Andamiro really wanted to have licenses popular hits in the West

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,080
such as Objection by Shakira (Te aviso te anuncio in Spanish)

46
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,840
It's my party by Thalia (Arrasando in
Spanish) and Just a Girl by No Doubt

47
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,480
In addition to Music by Madonna and we can't forget  Master of Puppets by Metallica

48
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,230
but apparently they couldn't buy them or their preices were too high to afford

49
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:27,160
so Andamiro hat to remove them from the list of available songs but they remained hidden on the disc.

50
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,860
Only Come to me  by Banya, Empire of the Sun by Novasonic

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,540
and Let's get the party started by Pink remained.

52
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,640
This last song was undoubtedly an icon of difficulty in those days

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,700
and plus the introduction nightmare mode

54
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,780
the difficulty of the game was exponentially increased

55
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,960
It is worth mentioning that some charts were redesigned using now long notes

56
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,220
increasing that way the difficulty. That's the case of Join the party.

57
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,780
As some of you may know

58
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,200
relesing a PC version of the game was a big mistake that represented huge

59
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,500
monetary loss to Andamiro because pirated copies were soon on the market

60
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,280
many people began to modify discs generating a wave of piracy.
